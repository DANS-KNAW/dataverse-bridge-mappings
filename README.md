Dataverse Bridge Mappings
=========================

Mapping of metadata from a Dataverse repository to other archives (for instance EASY) with XSLT.  
Used by Dataverse Bridge Plugins when archiving via the Dataverse Bridge Service.  
New versions of the mapping can be released without changing the plugin. 
Also this project contains unit test to help in development.
